					“A <strong>hacker</strong> is someone who loves to program or enjoys playful cleverness, or a combination of the two. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed <strong>hacking</strong>.”

					We're <strong>HackSoc</strong>, the free-to-join <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>computing</strong>, <strong>recreational programming</strong>, and <strong>hacking</strong> society at the <strong>University of Nottingham</strong>!
				</p>
				<p>
					Our members come from all different schools in the University, and we run our workshops and talks to cater to all different skill levels. So whether you've been programming your whole life, or you have never touched a computer, there'll be something for you!
				</p>
				<p>
					HackSoc is run by <a href="/committee">these people</a>!
