__Know some basic programming? Don't really like Java that much?__

In this workshop, run by our Dev Officer Daniel Cordell, you'll gain a basic understanding of the Kotlin programming language over two weeks, its similarities and differenes to Java, and why it's can be a nicer language to use.

Some programming knoweldge is required, but it does not necessarily need to be Java. While having some Java experience would be useful, it shuld not be necessary to understand some of the concepts explained.
