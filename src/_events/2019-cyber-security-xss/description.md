These workshops are designed to raise awareness toward web application security and teach students how to detect, prevent and respond to the latest cyber security challenges. All the workshops are based on OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) top 10.

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into a trusted website. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it. In this workshop, the students will learn how to detect and prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

 
All the workshops provided with a copy of [OWASP Broken Web Applications Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Broken_Web_Applications_Project) to practice and learn more about web application security.
