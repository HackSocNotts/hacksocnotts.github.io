__Want to learn Python? Never written any code before?__

In this workshop, run by our Hack Secretary Toby Jones, you'll gain a basic understanding of the Python programming language by building a simple web application using the Flask framework.

This event is open to anybody, no matter how much experience you have! Before turning up, make sure you've got the latest version of Python 3 on your laptop. Further details will follow closer to the event.
