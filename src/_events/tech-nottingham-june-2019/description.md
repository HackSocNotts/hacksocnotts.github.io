## DevOps: A Choose Your Own Adventure Story
_by [Louise Paling](https://twitter.com/short_louise) and [Liam Gulliver](https://twitter.com/lrgulliver)_

> "Hi there. Welcome to the successful YASC Ltd. I'm sure you've heard of us. What you might not know is that we're losing market share and our costs are rising. You did sign the NDA, right? Well, we need your help. We know that something needs to change but we're not sure where to start. We've heard that DevOps might be the answer. We definitely have silos in our company that don't work well with each other and we have a lot of manual steps that we want to automate."

This session will evaluate YASC's current position and the audience will decide what they do to improve the company's situation. Choose wisely and you will lead the company to be stronger than ever; choose poorly and you might just be responsible for record losses and widespread redundancies.

Are you writing code? Is it clear, concise and self-explanatory? Is it maintainable? Is it easy to get up and running? Do your colleagues understand it? Will your future self understand it after another six months of working on five other projects? Will a future stranger understand it in two years after the entire team have rotated and nobody is left who’s ever worked on it?

We’ll take a trip through some code and situations inspired by actual events and consider how we can ensure our code is fit for our colleagues and our future selves.
