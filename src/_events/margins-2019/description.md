**About margins**

margins is a free one-day conference for people from marginalised backgrounds that work in/with/around technology (or hope to break into the industry!).

Everyone is welcome to join us in Nottingham for a day filled with inspiration, solidarity and compassion.

**What does “being marginalised” mean?**

That’s a really good question! “Being from a marginalised background” means that someone is part of a group that is being dismissed as “insignificant” or treated unfairly as “outside the norm” in society. This includes (but is not limited to) someone's gender identity, gender expression, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, class, dis/ability, physical appearanceo or body size. (Please talk to us to make this description better!)

**As an attendee, what can I expect?**

margins is a small, intimate conference for about 100 people. It will be a day filled with workshops and talks that are centred around technology, inspiration and solidarity. The conference is split into two tracks that run at the same time: One for workshops and one for talks. In between, around and outside these tracks, the space offers a chance to chat, network and meet new people on the day. Lunch and snacks will be provided for free. While the schedule is not finalised, margins will run from around 10am until 4pm-ish.

**Do I have to identify as “marginalised” to attend?**

The conference is open to everybody. If you're not from a marginalised background, if the term “marginalised” doesn't sit right with you, if you're not sure if you belong: Please come around! We would love to see on the day.
