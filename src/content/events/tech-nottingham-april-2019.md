## If Building A Great Team Is The Question, Technology Is Not The Answer

Technology is invented to make our lives easier, to make us happier and in many ways bring humans closer together. But sadly, whilst technology can help us to solve problems, it can also create them. And instead of questioning our relationship with technology we simply layer on more, in an attempt to solve these new problems. We have reached a point where many of us have become so reliant on technology, that instead of thinking about the human beings we all are and how we work together, we get hung up on our technology, tools and processes in order to improve how effective our teams are. 

Tessa will share some examples of how focussing first and foremost on human interactions within your team or organisation will be the key to your success.

## Error: Property “X” Does Not Exist On Type “Genders”
_by [Aimee Gamble-Milner](https://twitter.com/aimeegamble)_

Collecting gender data is often overlooked when designing an application. It’s just a simple 2-option input, right?

On the surface, it’s straightforward to collect this data… but in reality, the go-to implementation could prevent some users from accessing your service. Additionally, trying to design an inclusive gender-input from scratch can rapidly cause complexity to escalate!

Aimee will discuss how we can make tech more inclusive for all genders whilst trying to keep it simple. This will include alternative form designs, as well as questioning if something else would be more suitable - or if we should collect that data at all? She will also explore how we can handle that data better after we’ve collected it. The poor storage and security of a users current and historical responses to this question could pose a risk to gender minorities.
