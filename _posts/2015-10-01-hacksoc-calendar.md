We've officially released our calendar for the year's events!

This year we have a Google calendar that will be updated with new events as-and-when they are announced, so you'll always be in the loop.

The calendar, for reference, can be seen here:

But who wants to constantly browse to our site to check this out? To make your lives easier, you can add it into your own calendar client via the following methods:

- [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100)
- [Apple Calendar](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11524)

These will require you to have one of these links, which will make it possible for you to import the full calendar straight in:

- [ICAL file format (`.ics`)](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/pqclo0bjutp9ld8qpdbtcf3jv8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
- [XML file format](https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/pqclo0bjutp9ld8qpdbtcf3jv8%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic)

For other clients, ping us on [mail@hacksocnotts.co.uk](mailto:mail@hacksocnotts.co.uk) and we'll point you in the right direction.
