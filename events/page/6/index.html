This workshop is a standalone session where we will be learning about GLSL shaders using shadertoy.
GLSL is a language, similar to C, which runs on the GPU. Typically used for the implementation of shaders in games (e.g. lighting effects, fog, etc), it can also be used as a full graphics library in its own right.

In this workshop, Haoyang Liu, a HackSoc member, will be giving us an introduction to React! This will be great for anyone who knows the basics of JavaScript and wants to get into web development. They will go over the creation of a SPA from scratch, showing how to use the library to build a lottery game.

Probably the most fun you can have while using C.
In this two-part workshop series, we will be going through the basics of game development using the popular SDL2 library (used for many real games, including most of Valve&rsquo;s catalogue), covering everything you need to make your own game from scratch!
In this, the first part of the series, we will go over the principles of SDL2, to give you a flavour of how it all works.

Its low power and cost allow it to be used in many smart applications.
This workshop, presented remotely by Devyansh Chawla all the way from India, will cover usage of OAK-D hardware for computer vision applications, in particular object detection. OAK-D comes with dedicated computer vision hardware, letting it do these tasks with very low power draw - useful all over the place, including IoT and embedded computing!

Pete is a Nottingham-based freelance programmer, and Microsoft Azure MVP, among many other things, and a regular guest speaker at HackSoc. On the 1st of Novemeber, he will be coming in to speakto us about home automation using Azure Precept. An overview can be found below:
In this demo-heavy talk, we run through using the Azure Percept Audio Module to control common appliances around our home.

It&rsquo;s used for anything from simple automation scripts, to web servers, to even the vast majority of AI these days! (In fact, the script to generate this event document for the website is written in Python!)
In this three-part workshop series, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the basics of Python, hopefully by the end reaching a level at which you, too, could make cool little Python scripts to automate things, or even write your own AIs or web servers!
