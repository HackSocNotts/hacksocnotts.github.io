Its low power and cost allow it to be used in many smart applications.
This workshop, presented remotely by Devyansh Chawla all the way from India, will cover usage of OAK-D hardware for computer vision applications, in particular object detection. OAK-D comes with dedicated computer vision hardware, letting it do these tasks with very low power draw - useful all over the place, including IoT and embedded computing!

Pete is a Nottingham-based freelance programmer, and Microsoft Azure MVP, among many other things, and a regular guest speaker at HackSoc. On the 1st of Novemeber, he will be coming in to speakto us about home automation using Azure Precept. An overview can be found below:
In this demo-heavy talk, we run through using the Azure Percept Audio Module to control common appliances around our home.

In this three-part workshop series, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the basics of Python, hopefully by the end reaching a level at which you, too, could make cool little Python scripts to automate things, or even write your own AIs or web servers!

Hacker speed dating is an opportunity to test your skills and work with others to solve a series of trivial challenges, were it not for the ever-rotating feed of projects you&rsquo;ll have to work on!
Get to work on a project and complete the task listed, but hurry and keep your code legible, because every so often you&rsquo;ll be booted off of one project and you&rsquo;ll have to start working on someone else&rsquo;s uncompleted task!

We&rsquo;ll start at the White Hart at 7pm!
This is a nice social event to start off the term, and while no, there is no real reason why these two societies have a joint pub crawl, it&rsquo;s always a fun night. No booking required, just find us at the White Hart (29 Gregory Street, Lenton)!

This will be our first event of the year, and a good taster to give you an idea of what kind of events we&rsquo;ll be running throughout the year. At 4:30pm, we&rsquo;ll be gathering in C33 where the committee will be giving three short-ish talks on various tech-related topics:
An introduction to game development by our President A talk about bug bounties by our Cyber Security Secretary And two more, details to be confirmed The event in whole is supposed to take around two hours, finishing at approximately 6:30pm, to give you plenty of time to have dinner afterwards.
