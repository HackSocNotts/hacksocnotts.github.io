This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C33 (provisionally, subject to room bookings.

We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.

Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&rsquo;t necessary, as we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot!
