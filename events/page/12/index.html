This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!

Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&rsquo;t necessary, as we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot!
