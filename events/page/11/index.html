This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
We will also have coffee and tea.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C33 (provisionally, subject to room bookings.

It&rsquo;s becoming a very popular language in a lot of spaces, especially on the web and in crypto.
This talk will introduce you to the basics of the Go programming language including installation, making a project, and the language itself.

We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
