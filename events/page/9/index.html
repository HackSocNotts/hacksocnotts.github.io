On Thursday the 31st we have our AGM, where we will be electing next year&rsquo;s committee. Candidates will give a short speech on why they should do the role, and then you, the members, will vote in the candidates you want to see on next year&rsquo;s committee.
There will be free pizza for everyone that comes to the AGM, so please come along to vote!

This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
We will also have coffee and tea.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C33.

Chances are you&rsquo;re using something that runs on it right now. AWS provides compute, databases, storage, API services, but also some more obscure things like blockchain and even managed satellite groundstations and robotics applications.
In this workshop, you&rsquo;ll learn to make a &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; (yes, I know - it&rsquo;s a dumb name&mldr;) application from scratch using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.

Each person will work with an individual microcontroller and electronic components to create a memory game, similar to the Simon Says electronic game.</div></article><article><h1><a href=http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-10-programming-cafe/>Programming Café</a></h1><time datetime=2022-03-10T00:00:00>10 Mar 2022</time><div>Hello and welcome to our programming cafe events!

In this workshop GenSec James will be talking and walking you through hosting a web server serving the popular game Wordle, including steps such as DNS, Firewall, Ports, security hardening and other best practices.
This knowledge can be applied to hosting almost any service in an internet accessible way, whether a website, game server, API, or something else.

How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn&rsquo;t it an interpreted language?
All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up.

It&rsquo;s one of the most popular engines in industry and makes it very easy to get started making games using the C# programming language.
In this workshop you&rsquo;ll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!
No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful.
