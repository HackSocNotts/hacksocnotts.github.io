How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn&rsquo;t it an interpreted language?
All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up.

It&rsquo;s one of the most popular engines in industry and makes it very easy to get started making games using the C# programming language.
In this workshop you&rsquo;ll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!
No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful.

This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
We will also have coffee and tea.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C3.

To celebrate this, I (Jacob) am going to download many different historical C compilers and demonstrate how the language evolved from a simple language originally written in assembly, to the language we all know and love today.</div></article><article><h1><a href=http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-02-15-python3/>Introduction to Python - Workshop 3</a></h1><time datetime=2022-02-15T00:00:00>15 Feb 2022</time><div>Do you want to learn how to program? In this workshop you will be introduced to the Python Programming Language, and be taught the basic concepts that underpin programming generally.
In this session, we&rsquo;ll put (almost) everything you&rsquo;ve learned into making a hangman game!
This workshop is part three of a three part series that will be running throughout February. If you enjoy it be sure to come along to the other ones.

He was involved in getting Nottingham University on the net in it&rsquo;s early days, and it wasn&rsquo;t all plain sailing. So - a bit of history, a bit about protocols, a bit of politics, and a lot of good old fashioned hacking to get us where we are today.
