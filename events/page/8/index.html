Hacker speed dating is an opportunity to test your skills and work with others to solve a series of trivial challenges, were it not for the ever-rotating feed of projects you&rsquo;ll have to work on!
Get to work on a project and complete the task listed, but hurry and keep your code legible, because every so often you&rsquo;ll be booted off of one project and you&rsquo;ll have to start working on someone else&rsquo;s uncompleted task!

It&rsquo;s used for anything from simple automation scripts, to web servers, to even the vast majority of AI these days! (In fact, the script to generate this event document for the website is written in Python!)
In this three-part workshop series, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the basics of Python, hopefully by the end reaching a level at which you, too, could make cool little Python scripts to automate things, or even write your own AIs or web servers!

We&rsquo;ll start at the White Hart at 7pm!
This is a nice social event to start off the term, and while no, there is no real reason why these two societies have a joint pub crawl, it&rsquo;s always a fun night. No booking required, just find us at the White Hart (29 Gregory Street, Lenton)!

This will be our first event of the year, and a good taster to give you an idea of what kind of events we&rsquo;ll be running throughout the year. At 4:30pm, we&rsquo;ll be gathering in C33 where the committee will be giving three short-ish talks on various tech-related topics:
An introduction to game development by our President A talk about bug bounties by our Cyber Security Secretary And two more, details to be confirmed The event in whole is supposed to take around two hours, finishing at approximately 6:30pm, to give you plenty of time to have dinner afterwards.

This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
We will also have coffee, tea, and biscuits.
The event will take place in A07, in the Computer Science Building.

But what is OneAPI? It&rsquo;s a toolkit for enabling accelerated heterogeneous computing that is platform and vendor agnostic. This promises to be a very interesting workshop, so be sure to come along!
