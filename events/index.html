In this workshop, Haoyang Liu, a HackSoc member, will be giving us an introduction to React! This will be great for anyone who knows the basics of JavaScript and wants to get into web development. They will go over the creation of a SPA from scratch, showing how to use the library to build a lottery game.

Probably the most fun you can have while using C.
In this two-part workshop series, we will be going through the basics of game development using the popular SDL2 library (used for many real games, including most of Valve&rsquo;s catalogue), covering everything you need to make your own game from scratch!
In this, the first part of the series, we will go over the principles of SDL2, to give you a flavour of how it all works.

Its low power and cost allow it to be used in many smart applications.
This workshop, presented remotely by Devyansh Chawla all the way from India, will cover usage of OAK-D hardware for computer vision applications, in particular object detection. OAK-D comes with dedicated computer vision hardware, letting it do these tasks with very low power draw - useful all over the place, including IoT and embedded computing!
