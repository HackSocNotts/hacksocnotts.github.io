SUMMARY:Hosting Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Even if you have the best service in the world, it is all for nought if no one can access it. In this workshop GenSec James will be talking and walking you through hosting a web server serving the popular game Wordle, including steps such as DNS, Firewall, Ports, security hardening and other best practices.
This knowledge can be applied to hosting almost any service in an internet accessible way, whether a website, game server, API, or something else. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-03-hosting-workshop/

SUMMARY:Python Internals Talk
DESCRIPTION:What actually happens when you tell Python to print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)? How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn&rsquo;t it an interpreted language?
All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up. Concepts covered will include scanning &amp; parsing, compilation, and evaluation, among many more, giving you an insight the entire journey your program takes from source code to execution.
Since the Python interpreter&rsquo;s source code is surprisingly readable, I&rsquo;ll be going through some snippets of C code, but understanding of C is by no means necessary. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-01-python-internals-talk/

SUMMARY:Unity Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Unity is a game engine used by both professionals and hobbyists for millions of games. It&rsquo;s one of the most popular engines in industry and makes it very easy to get started making games using the C# programming language.
In this workshop you&rsquo;ll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!
No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful. Also please try to install Unity in advance, since it will probably take quite a while on the University wifi.

SUMMARY:UK networking - What on earth were we thinking?
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, Dr Julian Onions talks a little about the history of email, and how we gradually connected our computers together so we could communicate world wide and work on projects together. He was involved in getting Nottingham University on the net in it&rsquo;s early days, and it wasn&rsquo;t all plain sailing. So - a bit of history, a bit about protocols, a bit of politics, and a lot of good old fashioned hacking to get us where we are today.
Dr Julian Onions is a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham, and was one of the people involved in the very earliest rollout of internet and email in the UK. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-02-10-early-email-talk/

SUMMARY:Introduction to Go
DESCRIPTION:Go is a modern systems programming language designed at Google by a bunch of clever people (including Ken Thompson who create UNIX and B, C&rsquo;s predecessor, so you know it must be good.) It&rsquo;s becoming a very popular language in a lot of spaces, especially on the web and in crypto.
This talk will introduce you to the basics of the Go programming language including installation, making a project, and the language itself. It&rsquo;s very similar to other C-like languages so if you know any of those then this talk will build on top of that knowledge, but it&rsquo;s by no means a requirement.
I&rsquo;ll be making a small web server from scratch as a demonstration of the language and the libraries that it comes with, but Go can be used for just about anything, including games, command line applications, GUI software, blockchain software, and almost anything else.
This event will take place in LT1 in the exchange building. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-go-workshop/

SUMMARY:Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with .NET 5, Blazor and SignalR
DESCRIPTION:In this talk Pete Gallagher takes you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
Next we’ll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely! Finally we’ll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!
This talk appeals to all knowledge levels and anyone interested in getting into STEM, Electronics and Robotics. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-26/

SUMMARY:Workshop: Discord Bots
DESCRIPTION:Come along to our first workshop of the year and learn how to make your own Discord bot using JavaScript!
Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&rsquo;t necessary, as we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot! We&rsquo;ll be available to help with any problems, so even if you&rsquo;re a total beginner to programming, you should end up with a working bot you can add to your Discord server.
If you&rsquo;ve looked into Discord bots recently, you&rsquo;ll probably have heard about slash commands taking over. Discord seems to want to let bots only interact via users typing in actual commands, so this will be mostly what we cover, but we&rsquo;ll go over the &ldquo;old way&rdquo; of doing things as well.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building LT3. If you want to follow along, you&rsquo;ll need to bring a laptop, since you&rsquo;ll need to install some software and we don&rsquo;t have access to the computer science lab at the moment.
If possible, it would save time to install node.js (the programming language we&rsquo;ll be using) in advance, as well as the discord.js library. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to do this, feel free to reach out in the discord, or we can help you at the beginning of the workshop. Also, it would help if you have a Discord account.
