SUMMARY:Summer Jubilee BBQ
DESCRIPTION:After exams have finished, HackSoc will be doing our patriotic duty and hosting a BBQ to celebrate the Queen&rsquo;s Platinum Jubilee. This will be a great place to unwind from the stresses of exams, and as it is during the day, at 2pm, you can still go out to the street parties in the evening.
As this event is a BBQ, food and drink will be provided. If you are thinking of coming along, please can you fill out a quick form at hacksoc.net/jubilee-bbq so we know how much food to get.
This event will be taking place on the island on the lake behind the Computer Science building at 2pm on Friday the 3rd of June.
This is going to be the last HackSoc event for the year, so be sure to come along! More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-06-03-jubilee-bbq/

SUMMARY:Intel OneAPI Workshop
DESCRIPTION:We&rsquo;ll be starting off the term on the 5th of May at 7PM, Computer Science A07 with an event sponsored by Intel, where we will talk about OneAPI and teach you how to use it to plot the Mandelbrot set!
But what is OneAPI? It&rsquo;s a toolkit for enabling accelerated heterogeneous computing that is platform and vendor agnostic. This promises to be a very interesting workshop, so be sure to come along!
Additionally, since it&rsquo;s sponsored by Intel, we&rsquo;ll be serving some free pizza and giving out some Intel swag, including t-shirts, hoodies, and a notebook!
(If you&rsquo;re familiar with C++ then feel free to take your laptop and follow along! We recommend installing the OneAPI toolkit along with the OpenCV library for C++ beforehand if you want to do this, since this could take 20 minutes to do. If you need assistance in installing it you are welcome to come along at 6:30 pm and we will help you get it installed.)

SUMMARY:AWS 'Serverless' Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is a computing platform which powers somewhere between 30-50% of the entire web. Chances are you&rsquo;re using something that runs on it right now. AWS provides compute, databases, storage, API services, but also some more obscure things like blockchain and even managed satellite groundstations and robotics applications.
In this workshop, you&rsquo;ll learn to make a &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; (yes, I know - it&rsquo;s a dumb name&hellip;) application from scratch using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
These services handle the running of containerised code, managing a database, and letting you call upon your code via a HTTP interface.
Nothing needs to be installed in advance for this workshop, but an AWS account will be useful (I believe you can just sign in with a normal Amazon account.) I&rsquo;ll be using Python for this, but other languages are available so it&rsquo;s partially up to you (although using Python will make things a bit easier.) More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-17-aws-workshop/

SUMMARY:Python Internals Talk
DESCRIPTION:What actually happens when you tell Python to print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)? How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn&rsquo;t it an interpreted language?
All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up. Concepts covered will include scanning &amp; parsing, compilation, and evaluation, among many more, giving you an insight the entire journey your program takes from source code to execution.
Since the Python interpreter&rsquo;s source code is surprisingly readable, I&rsquo;ll be going through some snippets of C code, but understanding of C is by no means necessary. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-01-python-internals-talk/

SUMMARY:Unity Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Unity is a game engine used by both professionals and hobbyists for millions of games. It&rsquo;s one of the most popular engines in industry and makes it very easy to get started making games using the C# programming language.
In this workshop you&rsquo;ll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!
No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful. Also please try to install Unity in advance, since it will probably take quite a while on the University wifi.

SUMMARY:Introduction to Go
DESCRIPTION:Go is a modern systems programming language designed at Google by a bunch of clever people (including Ken Thompson who create UNIX and B, C&rsquo;s predecessor, so you know it must be good.) It&rsquo;s becoming a very popular language in a lot of spaces, especially on the web and in crypto.
This talk will introduce you to the basics of the Go programming language including installation, making a project, and the language itself. It&rsquo;s very similar to other C-like languages so if you know any of those then this talk will build on top of that knowledge, but it&rsquo;s by no means a requirement.
I&rsquo;ll be making a small web server from scratch as a demonstration of the language and the libraries that it comes with, but Go can be used for just about anything, including games, command line applications, GUI software, blockchain software, and almost anything else.
This event will take place in LT1 in the exchange building. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-go-workshop/

SUMMARY:Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with .NET 5, Blazor and SignalR
DESCRIPTION:In this talk Pete Gallagher takes you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
Next we’ll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely! Finally we’ll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!
This talk appeals to all knowledge levels and anyone interested in getting into STEM, Electronics and Robotics. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-26/

DESCRIPTION:Hello and welcome to our programming cafe events!
This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C33 (provisionally, subject to room bookings.) More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-14-prog-cafe/

SUMMARY:Workshop: Discord Bots
DESCRIPTION:Come along to our first workshop of the year and learn how to make your own Discord bot using JavaScript!
Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&rsquo;t necessary, as we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot! We&rsquo;ll be available to help with any problems, so even if you&rsquo;re a total beginner to programming, you should end up with a working bot you can add to your Discord server.
If you&rsquo;ve looked into Discord bots recently, you&rsquo;ll probably have heard about slash commands taking over. Discord seems to want to let bots only interact via users typing in actual commands, so this will be mostly what we cover, but we&rsquo;ll go over the &ldquo;old way&rdquo; of doing things as well.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building LT3. If you want to follow along, you&rsquo;ll need to bring a laptop, since you&rsquo;ll need to install some software and we don&rsquo;t have access to the computer science lab at the moment.
If possible, it would save time to install node.js (the programming language we&rsquo;ll be using) in advance, as well as the discord.js library. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to do this, feel free to reach out in the discord, or we can help you at the beginning of the workshop. Also, it would help if you have a Discord account.
