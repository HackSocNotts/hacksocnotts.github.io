SUMMARY:Game Development Workshop II - Shaders
DESCRIPTION:This Thursday we have the second part to the game development workshop series, which started last week! This workshop is a standalone session where we will be learning about GLSL shaders using shadertoy.\n
 GLSL is a language, similar to C, which runs on the GPU. Typically used for the implementation of shaders in games (e.g. lighting effects, fog, etc), it can also be used as a full graphics library in its own right. Shadertoy lets us write a program, in GLSL, where we can make cool graphics simply by providing an RGB colour for each pixel. Have a look here if you’re interested to see what other people have done.\n
 This should hopefully be a nice, relaxed workshop, and I will take you through the process of making a falling snowflake animation (maybe you could even turn it into a Christmas card!) perhaps with a tree in the middle.\n
 There’s nothing to install on your computer in advance for this one, and while some experience with C will be useful, it’s certainly not necessary (GLSL is closely related to, but not 100% compatible with, C). \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-11-17-game-development-workshop-ii-shaders/

SUMMARY:Get Started with React
DESCRIPTION:React is a widely used JavaScript library for easily making interactive web UIs, maintained by Meta and used all over the web for huge websites including even Facebook.\n
 In this workshop, Haoyang Liu, a HackSoc member, will be giving us an introduction to React! This will be great for anyone who knows the basics of JavaScript and wants to get into web development. They will go over the creation of a SPA from scratch, showing how to use the library to build a lottery game.\n
 Also, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) will be giving out some cool prizes to some people who attend so come along for that!\n
 This will be in A07, Comp Sci on Tuesday 15 November, starting around 7pm. You may want to install React on your computer in advance, but we can show you how to do that at the start of the workshop otherwise! \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-11-15-get-started-with-react/

SUMMARY:Game Development Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Game development with SDL2! Probably the most fun you can have while using C.\n
 In this two-part workshop series, we will be going through the basics of game development using the popular SDL2 library (used for many real games, including most of Valve’s catalogue), covering everything you need to make your own game from scratch!\n
 In this, the first part of the series, we will go over the principles of SDL2, to give you a flavour of how it all works. The nice thing about game development is once you know the basics, you can pretty much do anything, so this should set you up nicely to make some cool games on your own (or at the very least, to know what words to google to find out).\n
 The workshop will be taught using the C programming language, but if you don’t like thinking about memory management feel free to use another language of your choice. SDL2 is available for basically every language out there (bonus points if you use Haskell).\n
 If you’ve ever thought it would be cool to make a game, this is the workshop for you! But SDL2 isn’t just for games - anything graphical is possible. SDL is used for video playback software, emulators, and audio synths, to name just a few.\n
 If you plan to come, it may be useful to get SDL2 installed on your laptop ahead of time to save time. There are plenty of instructions for this on their website, https://www.libsdl.org. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-11-10-game-development-workshop/

SUMMARY:Devyansh Chawla: OAK-D Computer Vision Workshop
DESCRIPTION:OpenCV AI Kit with Depth, or OAK-D, is a hardware device with three cameras that can provide Spatial AI capabilities plus accelerated computer vision functions in products. Its low power and cost allow it to be used in many smart applications.\n
 This workshop, presented remotely by Devyansh Chawla all the way from India, will cover usage of OAK-D hardware for computer vision applications, in particular object detection. OAK-D comes with dedicated computer vision hardware, letting it do these tasks with very low power draw - useful all over the place, including IoT and embedded computing!\n
 Since this is a remote workshop, you are welcome to join from the comfort of your own home (a Zoom link will be released closer to the time), but we will be connecting as a group in A07 as well. I plan to bring snacks, too! \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-11-08-devyansh-chawla-oak-d-computer-vision-workshop/

SUMMARY:Home Automation with Azure Percept
DESCRIPTION:Pete Gallagher is back for another talk! Pete is a Nottingham-based freelance programmer, and Microsoft Azure MVP, among many other things, and a regular guest speaker at HackSoc. On the 1st of Novemeber, he will be coming in to speakto us about home automation using Azure Precept. An overview can be found below:\n
 In this demo-heavy talk, we run through using the Azure Percept Audio Module to control common appliances around our home. We start out by looking at what the Audio Module is, its features as well as Azure Percept Studio and Speech Studio. We then move on to a basic web-based implementation of how the Percept can control devices in our home. We then take a look at Azure Speech Studio and how we can create Custom Keywords, Commands, and Parameters. We’ll then dive into how we can implement a solution using Azure IoT Hubs, a Raspberry Pi, some simple electronics, and electrical wiring, to control items around our home. This talk will appeal to folks who want to understand how we can use voice to automate our homes, as well as those with an interest in how IoT services can be used to make our lives easier. Accessible to all experience levels, we’ll run through everything you need to get going with the Azure Percept Audio Module!\n
 Pete’s talks are always really interesting, and this one looks to be no different! \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-11-01-home-automation-with-azure-precept/

SUMMARY:AWS 'Serverless' Workshop
DESCRIPTION:Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is a computing platform which powers somewhere between 30-50% of the entire web. Chances are you’re using something that runs on it right now. AWS provides compute, databases, storage, API services, but also some more obscure things like blockchain and even managed satellite groundstations and robotics applications.\n
 In this workshop, you’ll learn to make a “serverless” (yes, I know - it’s a dumb name…) application from scratch using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.\n
 These services handle the running of containerised code, managing a database, and letting you call upon your code via a HTTP interface.\n
 Nothing needs to be installed in advance for this workshop, but an AWS account will be useful (I believe you can just sign in with a normal Amazon account.) I’ll be using Python for this, but other languages are available so it’s partially up to you (although using Python will make things a bit easier.) \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-17-aws-workshop/

DESCRIPTION:What actually happens when you tell Python to print("Hello, world!")? How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn’t it an interpreted language?\n
 All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up. Concepts covered will include scanning & parsing, compilation, and evaluation, among many more, giving you an insight the entire journey your program takes from source code to execution.\n
 Since the Python interpreter’s source code is surprisingly readable, I’ll be going through some snippets of C code, but understanding of C is by no means necessary. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-01-python-internals-talk/

 In this workshop you’ll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!\n
 No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful. Also please try to install Unity in advance, since it will probably take quite a while on the University wifi. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-02-24-unity-workshop/

SUMMARY:UK networking - What on earth were we thinking?
DESCRIPTION:In this talk, Dr Julian Onions talks a little about the history of email, and how we gradually connected our computers together so we could communicate world wide and work on projects together. He was involved in getting Nottingham University on the net in it’s early days, and it wasn’t all plain sailing. So - a bit of history, a bit about protocols, a bit of politics, and a lot of good old fashioned hacking to get us where we are today.\n
 Dr Julian Onions is a professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham, and was one of the people involved in the very earliest rollout of internet and email in the UK. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-02-10-early-email-talk/

SUMMARY:Introduction to Go
DESCRIPTION:Go is a modern systems programming language designed at Google by a bunch of clever people (including Ken Thompson who create UNIX and B, C’s predecessor, so you know it must be good.) It’s becoming a very popular language in a lot of spaces, especially on the web and in crypto.\n
 This talk will introduce you to the basics of the Go programming language including installation, making a project, and the language itself. It’s very similar to other C-like languages so if you know any of those then this talk will build on top of that knowledge, but it’s by no means a requirement.\n
 I’ll be making a small web server from scratch as a demonstration of the language and the libraries that it comes with, but Go can be used for just about anything, including games, command line applications, GUI software, blockchain software, and almost anything else.\n
 This event will take place in LT1 in the exchange building. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-go-workshop/

SUMMARY:Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with .NET 5, Blazor and SignalR
DESCRIPTION:In this talk Pete Gallagher takes you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.\n
 We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.\n
 Next we’ll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely! Finally we’ll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!\n
 This talk appeals to all knowledge levels and anyone interested in getting into STEM, Electronics and Robotics. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-26/

SUMMARY:Workshop: Discord Bots
DESCRIPTION:Come along to our first workshop of the year and learn how to make your own Discord bot using JavaScript!\n
 Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn’t necessary, as we’ll be explaining everything as we go along. We’ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.\n
 There’ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you’re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot! We’ll be available to help with any problems, so even if you’re a total beginner to programming, you should end up with a working bot you can add to your Discord server.\n
 If you’ve looked into Discord bots recently, you’ll probably have heard about slash commands taking over. Discord seems to want to let bots only interact via users typing in actual commands, so this will be mostly what we cover, but we’ll go over the “old way” of doing things as well.\n
 The event will take place in the Exchange Building LT3. If you want to follow along, you’ll need to bring a laptop, since you’ll need to install some software and we don’t have access to the computer science lab at the moment.\n
 If possible, it would save time to install node.js (the programming language we’ll be using) in advance, as well as the discord.js library. If you’re not sure how to do this, feel free to reach out in the discord, or we can help you at the beginning of the workshop. Also, it would help if you have a Discord account. \nMore details can be found at http://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-discord-bot-workshop/
