SUMMARY:Programming Caf√©
DESCRIPTION:Hello and welcome to our programming cafe events!
This is a much more laid back event than our workshops and talks, just rock up and work on a project, and speak to other people about their projects! We&rsquo;ll be encouraging people to do a brief show and tell towards the end, and you may end up spotlit in our newsletter!
The event will take place in the Exchange Building C33 (provisionally, subject to room bookings.) More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-28-prog-cafe/

SUMMARY:Building a Raspberry Pi Robot Arm with .NET 5, Blazor and SignalR
DESCRIPTION:In this talk Pete Gallagher takes you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.
Next we‚Äôll look at a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely! Finally we‚Äôll have a look at how we can use an Oculus Quest 2 to interact with our Robot Arm in VR!
This talk appeals to all knowledge levels and anyone interested in getting into STEM, Electronics and Robotics. More details can be found at <no value>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2021-10-26/

SUMMARY:Workshop: Discord Bots
DESCRIPTION:Come along to our first workshop of the year and learn how to make your own Discord bot using JavaScript!
Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&rsquo;t necessary, as we&rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot! We&rsquo;ll be available to help with any problems, so even if you&rsquo;re a total beginner to programming, you should end up with a working bot you can add to your Discord server.
If you&rsquo;ve looked into Discord bots recently, you&rsquo;ll probably have heard about slash commands taking over. Discord seems to want to let bots only interact via users typing in actual commands, so this will be mostly what we cover, but we&rsquo;ll go over the &ldquo;old way&rdquo; of doing things as well.
The event will take place in the Exchange Building LT3. If you want to follow along, you&rsquo;ll need to bring a laptop, since you&rsquo;ll need to install some software and we don&rsquo;t have access to the computer science lab at the moment.
If possible, it would save time to install node.js (the programming language we&rsquo;ll be using) in advance, as well as the discord.js library. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to do this, feel free to reach out in the discord, or we can help you at the beginning of the workshop. Also, it would help if you have a Discord account.
