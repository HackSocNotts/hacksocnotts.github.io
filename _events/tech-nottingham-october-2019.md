Companies know that in order to survive they need to be innovative. But how what does ‘being innovative’ look like? Where do ideas come from? What distinguishes a good idea from a bad idea? 

Using LEGO as a case study, Frances will talk about ways in which companies can approach innovation as a systematic, stepwise process, built on research and evidence.

In a noble effort to bring more people into the open source community, every October anyone can participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). All you need to do is contribute to an open source project and you could get a free t-shirt as well as the pride that comes with being a part of something bigger.

In this session we’ll introduce you to Hacktoberfest and open source, talk about how to get involved and then lead a workshop where people can get started making contributions. Bring your laptop along if you can!
