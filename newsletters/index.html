According to sources (Eva Davis) there was some confusion over who was responsible for the newsletter so please direct any hate to Joe and or Qiang (especially Joe).
The new committee have some very exciting plans for next academic year (including a HackSoc x CompSoc x WCS worldwide takeover, delayed until we can secure funding of one billion pounds).

This redesign coincides with our movement to a new branding for the society. If you&rsquo;ve been a HackSoc member for a little while, you&rsquo;ll remember our previous logo (the green castle on the left, below.) If you&rsquo;ve been a HackSoc member for even longer, you&rsquo;ll remember our old logo, which was very similar to the hacker-y logo (on the right.) You may also notice that the arrow is pointing from the newer one to the older one.
