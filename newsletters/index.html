This redesign coincides with our movement to a new branding for the society. If you&rsquo;ve been a HackSoc member for a little while, you&rsquo;ll remember our previous logo (the green castle on the left, below.) If you&rsquo;ve been a HackSoc member for even longer, you&rsquo;ll remember our old logo, which was very similar to the hacker-y logo (on the right.) You may also notice that the arrow is pointing from the newer one to the older one.
