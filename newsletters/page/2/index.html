Coming up in December we have a talk on the Quirks of the Final Fantasy games, and a talk on Automotive Cyber Security. Advent of Code In the run up to Christmas there is a series of programming challenged known as the Advent of Code. These are small challenges that should only take a short time to complete (though the later ones can take a little longer), and are a great way of testing and improving your programming skills.
