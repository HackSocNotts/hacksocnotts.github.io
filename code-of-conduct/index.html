HackSoc</h2><p>We&rsquo;re HackSoc, the free-to-join technology, computing, recreational programming, and hacking society at the University of Nottingham. We are a space for everyone, no matter their degree course or background. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religious beliefs.</p><p>Our code of conduct outlines our expectations for everyone who participates in our society, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.</p><h2 id=1-expected-behaviour>1. Expected Behaviour</h2><p>We expect all members of our society to treat each other with kindness and respect both online and in person. Any negative conduct will not be tolerated under any circumstances, this includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed at another person;</li><li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or other discriminatory jokes or comments;</li><li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material;</li><li>Posting or threatening to post other people&rsquo;s personal information;</li><li>Inappropriate photography or recording;</li><li>Inappropriate physical contact, make sure to always seek someone&rsquo;s consent before touching them in any way;</li><li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualised comments or jokes, inappropriate physical behaviour, or unwanted sexual advances;</li><li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (either online or in person);</li><li>Advocating for, or encouraging any of the above behaviours;</li><li>Having a Discord profile that includes any of the above.</li></ul><h2 id=2-consequences>2. Consequences</h2><p>Not following the expected behaviour guidelines will not be tolerated, and anyone who is given a warning should cease their harmful behaviour immediately.
Inability to do this could result in:</p><ul><li>Temporary or permanent banning from our discord server and/or our in person events;</li><li>Being reported to the Students Union and/or the University.
Depending on the severity of the unwanted behaviour, it could result in a temporary or permanent ban from society activities without warning. This will be at the discretion of the society committee under the advice of the Students Union.</li></ul><h2 id=3-reporting>3. Reporting</h2><p>If you have any concerns about the conduct of a member of the society (at a society event or online) please reach out to our President or Welfare Secretary (can be found on <a href=https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/committee>our committee page</a>). We will follow up on your concern quickly to ensure that our members feel safe and included at any of our events or online channels.</p><p>Please note that if the concerning behaviour didn’t happen in one of our spaces - we may not be able to directly sanction the individual. We can still assist you in reporting any events to the University, and we will actively make sure you still feel safe in our community. We can do this by warning the individual and can offer a ‘buddy’ to attend events with you if requested.</p><h2 id=4-addressing-grievances>4. Addressing grievances</h2><p>If you feel that you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating our code of conduct and are unable to resolve the matter with the committee, you should notify the Students Union who can handle your complaint in accordance with <a href=https://su.nottingham.ac.uk/make-change/democracy-and-elections/guidance-and-policy-documents>their existing governing policies</a>.</p><h2 id=5-scope>5. Scope</h2><p>We expect all members and attendees of our events (including committee members, external guests, sponsors, and speakers) to adhere to our code of conduct at all times. This includes at our events, on our discord server, or private conversations relating to society business.</p><p>As mentioned above (3), we take unacceptable behaviour outside of the scope of our society very seriously. We will not accept any of our members having their safety and wellbeing negatively impacted.</p><h2 id=6-other-applicable-policies>6.
