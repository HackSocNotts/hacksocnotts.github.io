With September right around the corner, I have decided that this is the perfect time to revive the (very dead) newsletter! According to sources (Eva Davis) there was some confusion over who was responsible for the newsletter so please direct any hate to Joe and or Qiang (especially Joe). 

The new committee have some very exciting plans for next academic year (including a HackSoc x CompSoc x WCS worldwide takeover, delayed until we can secure funding of one billion pounds). We will be bringing back some old favourites and trying out some new things too - every term-time Thursday of the 25/26 academic year. 

## Things to look foward to!

We will be at Welcome Fair (aka Freshers Fair, aka Sports and Socities Fair) - so please come and say hello for some free stickers :D

Programming cafe will *hopefully* be back running once a month infomally once term is underway (dates and times tbc)! This will be a chance for students to share and discuss projects and to enjoy the (often enraging) group programming vibes. 

We will also be reviving our very popular lightning talks (in the Rose and Crown!) where members can give a talk on literally anything they'd like - topics last year ranged from lecturer appreciation, FNAF theory, type theory, and actual lightning. Instead of rolling a pub quiz into this event we will be running a very chaotic game show style quiz later in autumn term - so make sure to brush up on your insanely specific trivia! 

Both Hacker Round Robin AND Lecture Slide Karaoke will be returning as well! So if you have any silly mini project ideas or heinously awful lectures you've been subjected to - please let me know! 

In terms of new events to look forward to: we will be running a Hackathons skills workshop at the start of the academic year, aiming to give practical advice (from travel and sleep, to programming skills) to students hoping to get involved in the hackathon scene next year! 

Loosely related: there **WILL** be a trip to the Nottingham HackSpace taking place this year (please hold [Oli](mailto:oli.sharp@hacksocnotts.co.uk) to this)

## HackNotts 25!

Our annual Hackathon is returning on the 25th to 26th of October. For those who don't know, HackNotts (like other student Hackathons ran across the country) is a free 24 hour competition where students studying any degree from any university are welcome to decend on the Computer Science building for a silly filled weekend! We are currently working hard on sponsors, logistics, and on the day events to make it as fun as possible for all of our participants. Tickets will be released by the end of September, and you can join our [mailing list](https://hacknotts.com/) to keep yourself updated.

## How to join our events

HackSoc is a completely free society! All of our events are free - you'll need a HackSoc membership (via the [SU](https://su.nottingham.ac.uk/activities/view/hacksoc)) to join our [discord server](https://hacksoc.net/discord) where we post our events schedule and have other fun conversations so please feel free to join us there! 

Theoretically the events should also be on our calendar, though this is slightly fucked at the moment. [Sammy](mailto:sammy.sahnine@hacksocnotts.co.uk) is very passionate about seeing it back to life though they are currently cursed with chronic living-in-Cambrige-for-a-year syndrome. Watch this space!

## Finishing thoughts!

I am so so excited for what next year has to bring for HackSoc - after being a member of the society for two years and making so many friends through events, the idea that I am now in charge is slightly wild (why I was trusted is a whole other question) but I cannot wait to (hopefully) spread the joy and whimsy far and wide.
