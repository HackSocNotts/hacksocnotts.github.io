Not one, but TWO workshops all about getting started with game development in Unity! Coming to a Jubilee Campus building near you soon!

In the first workshop, we focus on game design and mechanics, giving you the tools you need to take your ideas from just a thought to a fully fledged system. Next time, we learn to implement them!
