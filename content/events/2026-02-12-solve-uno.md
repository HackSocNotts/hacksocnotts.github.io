Uno isn’t a solved game, but that doesn’t mean you can’t try!!

Come and join HackSoc this Thursday, 12th of February in School of Computer Science A01 at 18:30 to play a few games of the hit card game Uno! There’s just one rule though, any moves you make must be decided by a program that you’ve written! No rules on any programming languages or other constraints, go wild!!

May the best program win. 🫡🫡🫡
