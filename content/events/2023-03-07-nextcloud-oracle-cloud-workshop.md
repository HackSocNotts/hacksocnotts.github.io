Privacy is a major concern today, nearly all of your data stored with 
Google, Microsoft, or Apple. Now how would you like to get yourself away 
from all of this and keep all of files stored on the cloud e.g. on Google 
drive, iCloud, Onedrive etc. on your own cloud system so that you don't 
have to worry about what these companies are doing with your data. There 
are many articles that have proven that the data stored on these clouds 
are accessible by these companies.

In this session, Rohit will show you how 
to host your own cloud for free using oracle cloud.
