React is a widely used JavaScript library for easily making interactive web 
UIs, maintained by Meta and used all over the web for huge websites 
including even Facebook.

In this workshop, Haoyang Liu, a HackSoc member, will be giving us an 
introduction to React! This will be great for anyone who knows the basics 
of JavaScript and wants to get into web development. They will go over the
creation of a SPA from scratch, showing how to use the library to build
a lottery game.

Also, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) will be giving out some 
cool prizes to some people who attend so come along for that!

This will be in A07, Comp Sci on Tuesday 15 November, starting around 7pm.
You may want to install React on your computer in advance, but we can
show you how to do that at the start of the workshop otherwise!
