React is a widely JavaScript library for easily making interactive web 
UIs, maintained by Meta and used all over the web for huge websites 
including even Facebook.

In this workshop, Haoyang Liu, a HackSoc member, will be giving us an 
introduction to React! This will be great for anyone who knows the basics 
of JavaScript and wants to get into web development. React is a really 
cool library, so this should be a very interesting workshop.

Also, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) will be giving out some 
cool prizes to some people who attend (I have been informed that this may 
be based on a Kahoot quiz...) so come along for that!

This will be in A07, Comp Sci on Tuesday 15 November, starting around 7pm.
