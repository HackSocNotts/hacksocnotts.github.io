Our second installment of the much-loved lecture slide karaoke! We promise there is no actual singing (unless you want to).

In lecture slide karaoke, should you wish to present, you will be given a lecture slide deck you have never seen and you will be presenting it as if you are the lecturer!

If you aren't comfortable to present, feel free to ask the "lecturer" really annoying questions!
