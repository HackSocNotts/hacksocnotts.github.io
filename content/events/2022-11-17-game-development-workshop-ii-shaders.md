This Thursday we have the second part to the game development workshop 
series, which started last week! This workshop is a standalone session 
where we will be learning about GLSL shaders using 
[shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/new).

GLSL is a language, similar to C, which runs on the GPU. Typically used 
for the implementation of shaders in games (e.g. lighting effects, fog, 
etc), it can also be used as a full graphics library in its own right. 
Shadertoy lets us write a program, in GLSL, where we can make cool 
graphics simply by providing an RGB colour for each pixel. Have a look 
[here](https://www.shadertoy.com/browse) if you're interested to see what 
other people have done.

This should hopefully be a nice, relaxed workshop, and I will take you 
through the process of making a falling snowflake animation (very seasonal 
- maybe you could even turn it into a Christmas card!) perhaps with a tree 
in the middle.

There's nothing to install on your computer in advance for this one, and 
while some experience with C will be useful, it's certainly not necessary 
(GLSL is closely related to, but not 100% compatible with, C).
