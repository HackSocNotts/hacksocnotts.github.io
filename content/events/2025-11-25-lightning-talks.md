Lightning talks is our annual (nearly) end of term event, where anyone can give a 5 minute talk on any topic they'd like. It will be taking place in the upstairs function room at the Rose & Crown.

The evening is not limited to tech, last year we had talks on type theory, FNAF lore, and actual lightning!

If you'd like to give a talk - please get in touch via this [form.](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/Q5Qkmaichu)

Please note if you do: you have the option to bring slides - but you don't have to!
