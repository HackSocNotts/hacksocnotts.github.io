OpenCV AI Kit with Depth, or OAK-D, is a hardware device with three 
cameras that can provide Spatial AI capabilities plus accelerated computer 
vision functions in products. Its low power and cost allow it to be used 
in many smart applications.

This workshop, presented remotely by Devyansh Chawla all the way from 
India, will cover usage of OAK-D hardware for computer vision 
applications, in particular object detection. OAK-D comes with dedicated 
computer vision hardware, letting it do these tasks with very low power 
draw - useful all over the place, including IoT and embedded computing!

Since this is a remote workshop, you are welcome to join from the comfort 
of your own home (a Zoom link will be released closer to the time), but we 
will be connecting as a group in A07 as well. I plan to bring snacks, too!
