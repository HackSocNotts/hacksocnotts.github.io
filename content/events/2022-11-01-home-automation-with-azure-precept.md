Pete Gallagher is back for another talk! Pete is a Nottingham-based 
freelance programmer, and Microsoft Azure MVP, among many other things, 
and a regular guest speaker at HackSoc. On the 1st of Novemeber, he will 
be coming in to speakto us about home automation using Azure Precept. An 
overview can be found below:

In this demo-heavy talk, we run through using the Azure Percept Audio 
Module to control common appliances around our home. We start out by 
looking at what the Audio Module is, its features as well as Azure Percept 
Studio and Speech Studio. We then move on to a basic web-based 
implementation of how the Percept can control devices in our home. We then 
take a look at Azure Speech Studio and how we can create Custom Keywords, 
Commands, and Parameters. We'll then dive into how we can implement a 
solution using Azure IoT Hubs, a Raspberry Pi, some simple electronics, 
and electrical wiring, to control items around our home. This talk will 
appeal to folks who want to understand how we can use voice to automate 
our homes, as well as those with an interest in how IoT services can be 
used to make our lives easier. Accessible to all experience levels, we'll 
run through everything you need to get going with the Azure Percept Audio 
Module!

Pete's talks are always really interesting, and this one looks to be no 
different!
