During this, we'll be all voting on the commitee members for the 2024-2025 academic year. We'll also vote to any changes this year to the constitution. If you want to see the candidates and changes, you can have a look on our Github: 
https://github.com/HackSocNotts/nominations/issues

You can also create an issue there if you wish to nominate yourself, until the AGM. 

Please come by to **LT2, Exchange Building** if you want to make your voice heard!
