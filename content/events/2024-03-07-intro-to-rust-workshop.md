During this event, our president will be covering the basic features of Rust, covering concepts like syntax, enums, structs and borrow-checkers. We will cover some of the basic features, and work towards implementing a LinkedList library in Rust.

Here is a good resource on the area, the Intro to Rust book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
