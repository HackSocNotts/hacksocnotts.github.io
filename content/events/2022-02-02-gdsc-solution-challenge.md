Want to have the chance to win up to $3,000 whilst helping solve one of 
the UN problems? Join GDSC this Thursday in A07 at 19:00 where we'll 
kick-off the solution challenge with an info session. 

The Google Developer Student Clubs Solution Challenge mission is to solve 
for one or more of the United Nations' 17 sustainable development goals 
using Google technology. This can be completed in teams of 1-4, and 
anything can be submitted as long as it meets the requirements. Prizes 
include cash prizes ($3,000 each), mentorship from Googlers, swag and 
feature on the Google Developers Blog. We should also be able to provide 
some free Google Domains (.dev, .app, .page) and some Google Cloud 
credits. Every participant will receive a certificate and digital Google 
Developers badge

The event should last around 40mins, but members of GDSC and Hacksoc will 
stick around for a general chat afterwards. We'll also provide some 
snacks. More information can be found here:
