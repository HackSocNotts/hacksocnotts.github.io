An introduction to the world of esoteric languages (esolangs), which are programming languages without any real useful/practical 
value, but they are quite funny.

Some Esolang examples are: Malborge, Piet, Chef, BrainFuck.

This trivial snippet descirbes how to briefly print("Hello world") in the esolang [Shakespeare](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Shakespeare):

```
The Art of the Introduction.
Romeo, a young man with remarkable patience.
Juliet, a likewise remarkable young woman.
The world.

[ Enter Romeo and Juliet ]

Romeo:
Listen to your heart!

Juliet:
Listen to your heart. Remember yourself.

[ Exeunt ]

[ Enter Romeo and Juliet ]

Romeo:
Am I more bright than you? If so let us proceed.
You are the sum of yourself and a big big big pig.

[ Exeunt ]

[ Enter Romeo and Juliet ]

Romeo:
Am I worse than the world? If so let us proceed.
Recall.

[ Exit ]

[ Enter Romeo and Juliet ]

Juliet:
Open your heart!

[ Exeunt ]
```
