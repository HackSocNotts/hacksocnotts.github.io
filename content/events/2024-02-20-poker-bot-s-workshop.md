Next Tuesday, 20th February at 18:15, we'll be holding a talk about an environment for game-playing AI agents to play poker against one another, made by none other than our president, Daudi Wampamba! 

During this event, we will be introducing the environment, written in Rust (with Python bindings). You'll then be able to design your own poker bot before the following week's event where we will pit all the bots against each other!
