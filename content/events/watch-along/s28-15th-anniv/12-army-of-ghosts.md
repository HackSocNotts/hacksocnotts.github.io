Watch Army of Ghosts with us on our Discord Server, 15 years to the minute (Prompt start at 7:00pm) after its first broadcast.

There's a hole in the fabric of reality, allowing the Doctor's old foes, the Cybermen, to return to Earth en masse. Don't you just hate it when that happens? Actually, this is a thrillingly exciting episode, the penultimate of the series and the first of a two-part finale that sees the Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose (Billie Piper) facing their greatest ever battle.
The pair land on Earth for a visit to Rose's mum Jackie (Camille Coduri), who's eagerly anticipating the arrival of her dad. But, as Rose gently points out, he died some years ago. So who is the mysterious visitor? Well, he's a ghost and he has an awful lot of ghostly friends, who pop down to Earth for brief appearances, courtesy of the mysterious Torchwood Institute and its sharp boss (Tracy-Ann Oberman).
But the ghosts aren't the friendly figures they at first seem - and also far from friendly are the contents of a mysterious, glowing sphere...
