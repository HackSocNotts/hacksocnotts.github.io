[Python](https://www.python.org) is one of the most popular programming 
languages in the world. It's used for anything from simple automation 
scripts, to web servers, to even the vast majority of AI these days! (In 
fact, the script to generate this event document for the website is 
written in Python!)

In this three-part workshop series, we'll walk you through the basics of 
Python, hopefully by the end reaching a level at which you, too, could 
make cool little Python scripts to automate things, or even write your own 
AIs or web servers!
