Hacker Round Robin (formerly Hacker Speed Dating) is an intense event in which participants are challenged to build a simple project.
The twist is, every 30 minutes, you'll be forced to move to the next computer. Work closely with the people next to you to catch up, not make it worse, and hopefully build a complete project!
