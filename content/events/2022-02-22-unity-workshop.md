Unity is a game engine used by both professionals and hobbyists for millions of games. It's one of the most popular engines in industry and makes it very easy to get started making games using the C# programming language.

In this workshop you'll learn the basics of the Unity game engine, as well as the C# language, and make a small game from start to finish!

No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful. Also please try to [install Unity](https://store.unity.com/#plans-individual) in advance, since it will probably take quite a while on the University wifi.
