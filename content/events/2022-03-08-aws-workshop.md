[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), or AWS, is a computing platform which powers somewhere between 30-50% of
the entire web. Chances are you're using something that runs on it right now. AWS provides
compute, databases, storage, API services, but also some more obscure things like blockchain
and even managed satellite groundstations and robotics applications.

In this workshop, you'll learn to make a "serverless" (yes, I know - it's a dumb name...) application from scratch using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
These services handle the running of containerised code, managing a database, and letting you call upon your code via
a HTTP interface.

Nothing needs to be installed in advance for this workshop, but an AWS account will be useful (I believe you can just
sign in with a normal Amazon account.) I'll be using Python for this, but other languages are available so it's partially up
to you (although using Python will make things a bit easier.)
