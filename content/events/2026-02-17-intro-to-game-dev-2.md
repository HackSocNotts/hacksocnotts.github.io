Not one, but TWO workshops all about getting started with game development in Unity! Coming to a Jubilee Campus building near you soon!

In the first workshop, we focused on game design and mechanics. Now, we learn about implementing them in Unity. Always wanted to learn how to take your ideas from just a thought to a fully fledged system? Now's your chance!
