For our first event of the year, we will be bringing back an old favorite - Hacker Round Robin! Hackers (that's you!) are challenged to build a simple project HOWEVER! every 10 minutes you will have to move to another computer (and another project!). The only thing you will have to look at is the last person's code.

Hopefully by the end of this we have a bunch of fully functioning projects (and not a mess!). This event is open to all programming skill levels, and you are welcome to go around alone or in pairs.

See you there!
