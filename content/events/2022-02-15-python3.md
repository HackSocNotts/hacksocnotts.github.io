Do you want to learn how to program? In this workshop you will be introduced to the Python Programming Language, and be taught the basic concepts that underpin programming generally.

In this session, we'll put (almost) everything you've learned into making a hangman game!

This workshop is part three of a three part series that will be running throughout February. If you enjoy it be sure to come along to the other ones.
