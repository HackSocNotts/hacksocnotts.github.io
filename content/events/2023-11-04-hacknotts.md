HackNotts is an annual hackathon hosted by HackSoc at the University of Nottingham. It's a two-day overnight hackathon for all skill levels taking place on November 4th and 5th 2023.

This is a great opportunity to connect with like-minded people and discuss new ideas and projects. Teams are not mandatory, as said previously. There will be loads of opportunities to find one though, including a team building workshop on the day along with the #find-a-team Discord channel. Aside from the hacking, workshops and food, there will also be games and other events to keep you entertained.

There will be numerous workshops during the event with a variety of topics, from hardware to software and life skills. There will be something for everyone! All meals and drinks will be provided for free including lunch on both days with dinner on the 4th and breakfast on the 5th.
