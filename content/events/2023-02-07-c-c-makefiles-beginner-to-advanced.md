Do you have issues when your C or C++ projects get too big, and constantly updating makefiles or other build scripts becomes unwieldy? Do you know what $<, $@, and $^
mean in a makefile? Do you want to make your makefiles work better cross-platform? If your answers to those questions are yes, no, and yes, respectively, then this
workshop may be useful for you!

We'll talk about what makefiles are, why they're useful, how to start using them, and then look at some more advanced topics to make more complex (and useful)
makefiles.

There are no hard prerequisites for this workshop, but ideally:

 - You're familiar with at least the basics of C programming.
 - You're using Linux or similar (WSL is fine, or if you really want, get some Make implementation for native Windows)
