We will be starting the evening with Lightning talks, where anyone can give a (5-10 minute) light talk, about any topic. We'll end the night with a pub quiz, as a way to see out the semester.

Please get in touch if you want to do a lightning talk. 

Feel free to come along if you want to listen and test your tech knowledge.
