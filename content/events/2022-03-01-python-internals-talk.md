What actually happens when you tell Python to `print("Hello, world!")`? How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to *compile* Python code - isn't it an interpreted language?

All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up. Concepts covered will include scanning & parsing, compilation, and evaluation, among many more, giving you an insight the entire journey your program takes from source code to execution.

Since the Python interpreter's source code is surprisingly readable, I'll be going through some snippets of C code, but understanding of C is by no means necessary.
