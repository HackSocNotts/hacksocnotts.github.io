Have you ever used ChatGPT, Claude, or DeepSeek and wondered how they worked? In this talk we will be going on a detailed deep dive of the structure of Generative Pre-trained Transformer Models and how they work, as well as how to run them locally on your computer for personal use, or even Hacks! We'll also investigate some of the recent developments of these models, and what the whole deekseek drama was about. **No previous ML experience needed, Attention is all you need!** Hosted by our very own HackSoc Member, Robotics Enthusiast, and PhD Student **Adrian Vecina Tercero**!
