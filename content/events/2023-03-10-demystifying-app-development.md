One of our members, Demi, will be giving a talk to help you understand the general concepts and ideas around mobile app development. This will include:
- an overview of the app development industry, how it works and where it's going
- the overarching concepts around app development, what they mean and how they work together
- what you can achieve when you apply these concepts together

This talk is tailored towards those new to app development but anyone is welcome!
