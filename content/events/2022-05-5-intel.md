We'll be starting off the term on the **5th of May at 7PM, Computer Science A07** with an event **sponsored by Intel**, where we will talk about OneAPI and teach you how to use it to plot the Mandelbrot set!
But what _is_ OneAPI? It's a toolkit for enabling accelerated heterogeneous computing that is platform and vendor agnostic. This promises to be a very interesting workshop, so be sure to come along!

Additionally, since it's sponsored by Intel, we'll be serving some **free pizza** and giving out some **Intel swag, including t-shirts, hoodies, and a notebook**!

(If you're familiar with C++ then feel free to take your laptop and follow along! We recommend installing the OneAPI toolkit along with the OpenCV library for C++ beforehand if you want to do this, since this could take 20 minutes to do)
