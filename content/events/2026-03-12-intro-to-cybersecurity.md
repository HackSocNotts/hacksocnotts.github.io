Interested in getting started with cybersecurity? Attend a talk with Xavier Carpent, a lecturer specialising in Cyber Security and with a specialisation in applied cryptography and authentication.

In this event, Xavier will give an overview of a set of protocols called Private Set Intersection (PSI). Some constructions, use cases, and open research questions will be explored. The canonical PSI protocol allows two parties (both with their own set of elements) to interact in a way that one party learns the intersection of the sets and nothing else (and the other party learns nothing). Along the way, other related "private" types of protocols and their applications will be discussed. These privacy-by-design protocols can be used in all sorts of applications that deal with personal data. Some examples:
  
- Intersection between "people I've been in contact with" and "sick people"? (where both sets best remain private!)
- Has my password been leaked? (without revealing my password!)
- What is the total salary of people in the room? (without revealing individual salaries!)

Time permitting, Xavier will also briefly discuss a recently discovered attack on 2G networks (yes, they are still in use!)."
