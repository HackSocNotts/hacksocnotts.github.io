title: Calendar
---

This is HackSoc's master calendar. All of our currently planned events should be on here&mdash;we try to run an event every Tuesday and Thursday during term-time, although this isn't always possible.

For those who are interested (or for those who would rather view events via their terminal) the raw data going into this calendar can be found at [/events/index.json](/events/index.json). Also, a list of all events, future and past, can be found at [/events](/events).

## Subscribing to Our Calendar

If you would like to add our calendar to your own calendar client, we host a `.ics` file at [/events/index.ics](/events/index.ics). Make sure you add this as a *calendar subscription* rather than just importing the file, so that it automatically updates over time.
