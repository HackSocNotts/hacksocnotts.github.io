</header>
<h1 id="general-secretary">General Secretary</h1>
<h2 id="james-harvey">James Harvey</h2>
<p>I’m James, a first year computer science student who would like to be
GenSec at HackSoc next year.</p>
<p>I believe that I can handle the administration of HackSoc as I have
been an active member of the society. I’m obviously interested in
programming and technology, hence why I’m running for a position at
HackSoc 🙃</p>
<p>(Also, it just makes sense that a James replaces a James)</p>
<h2 id="daudi-wampamba">Daudi Wampamba</h2>
<p>To those who don’t know me, I am Daudi Wampamba, I am a Second Year
Computer Science student, and I have a passion for technology (and the
80s). I have been sharing my love of electronics and programming with
anyone who will listen for years. I started a programming club in my
secondary (Fun fact: I knew more about programming than my teacher
there, but that’s more a commentary on the state of Computer Science
education in the UK), I used to volunteer at the National Museum of
Computing, where I developed a love for retro technology, and helped to
teach people of all ages about the marvel of computing, and I even
learned BBC BASIC while I was there (although I’m bound to be more than
a bit rusty by this point). As General Secretary, I would aim to improve
the breadth of topics the society runs events on outside of just
computer science out towards more areas around the central topic of
hacking. In addition, with the lifting of restrictions, I will push for
wider participation in Hackathons across the country and facilitate
relationships with counterpart societies at other universities for
inter-society events, as well as attempting to have at least one joint
event a month with the other societies at the university that may have
nothing to do with HackSoc, with the goal of creating novel experiences
that feature interesting applications of technology for both our members
and the members of other societies (and hopefully expand our
membership)</p>
<h1 id="president">President</h1>
<h2 id="zac-garby">Zac Garby</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Zac, a 3rd year Comp Sci student and current Development
Secretary and Graphics Officer at HackSoc. I’m probably starting a PhD
next year so I’ll be around for a few more years at least.</p>
<p>I’d like to run for President for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am already very involved in the organisation of the society so I
already know how things work for the most part.</li>
<li>I am prepared to be very actively involved in the society, as I
expect to have a lot of spare time next year. This should let me make
sure everything is running smoothly, and also make some much-needed
changes to the society (i.e. merging certain committee roles, making
sure rooms are booked properly each week.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am elected President, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to build better relationships with other societies (e.g. joint
events)</li>
<li>Try to rebuild our relationship with the School of Computer
Science</li>
<li>Try to develop relationships with industry, e.g. through Tech
Nottingham, to get funding and talks</li>
<li>Work on keeping event engagement high throughout the year, not just
at the events with pizza
<ul>
<li>I think with better advertising, and possibly more social events,
this should be very possible.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="development-secretary">Development Secretary</h1>
<h2 id="jacob-garby">Jacob Garby</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Jacob - I’m a third year computer scientist, and HackSoc’s
treasurer. As well as being the treasurer, I organised a few talks and
workshops for the society, so I already have experience doing that. One
thing I would like to change is I think it would be good to run some
events that are on more advanced topics, on the request of a few people
that have asked me to do that.</p>
<h1 id="cyber-security-secretary">Cyber Security Secretary</h1>
<h2 id="vasile-robert-grigoras">Vasile Robert Grigoras</h2>
<p>Hi. I am Vasile Robert Grigoras. I am a student studying Msci AI. I
have attended many cyber security workshops this year and have found a
passion in the cyber space. Having completed many workshops, I was able
to find confidence in my abilities. I have previous experience in the
cyber space by doing some CTF challenges. The fields I enjoy most are AI
and Cyber security. I enjoy programming as well, my favourite
programming languages are Python, C and JavaScript. In my spare time I
like to code applications ranging from web to cyber security. Currently
I am developing an AI application alongside a cryptography project. I
volunteer at IntoUniversity as a mentor, I am currently mentoring a
young person on their path to higher education. I help my mentee by
building skills such as critical thinking, confidence as well as helping
improve grades. There are many interesting topics in cyber security. I
would like to continue doing workshops to build on the fundamentals as
well as making workshops on newer and more exciting topics. First area
would be how AI can be used in cyber security. Second area would be
understanding malware and how it works. Thirdly is cryptography and how
it works. These fields are very interesting and with the rise of AI it
would be interesting to see how cyber security application develop in
the future.</p>

<h1 id="marketing-secretary">Marketing Secretary</h1>
<h2 id="toby-clark">Toby Clark</h2>
<p><strong>Toby Clark</strong> - Marketing Secreatry I’m a Computer
Science Student. My favourite fields of computer science are
simulations, documentation and software architecture. I started
programming when I was 13 - mainly with Python &amp; LUA, but also
playing around with Java. I made and published my own game to Steam when
I was 15 (TV189) and have been toying with different parts of computer
science since, recently working as a freelance web-developer. My
projects have been featured in several newsletters. My interest has
dated back far beyond this though, and I want to share that enthusiasm
with others.</p>
<p>I want to expand the circle of HackSoc beyond just a subset of
computer science students to other subjects, and try to get people who
aren’t involved in Computer Science to get involved and learn through
the workshops and tutorials HackSoc have to offer. At the moment it
seems like a computer-science society only, and I want to help expand
our horizons beyond comp-sci students and to anyone looking to get
involved with computers or programming. Helping people develop
marketable skills as-well as hobbies is in my interests - selling
programming as if it were a commodity and then ensuring people fall in
love with the craft once they start is essentially what I want to
do.</p>
<h1 id="industrial-partners-secretary">Industrial Partners
Secretary</h1>
<h2 id="daudi-wampamba-1">Daudi Wampamba</h2>
<p>To those who don’t know me, I am Daudi Wampamba, I am a Second Year
Computer Science student, and I have a passion for technology (and the
80s). I have been sharing my love of electronics and programming with
anyone who will listen for years. I started a programming club in my

teach people of all ages about the marvel of computing, and I even
learned BBC BASIC while I was there (although I’m bound to be more than
a bit rusty by this point). Being Industrial Partners Secretary this
year has been a real learning experience for me. The society seems to
have a lot of potential for sponsorship and building out relationships
with industry, however, with recent events being as they are, and the
departure of former committee members, most of our business
relationships have had to have started out from scratch. If re-elected,
I would strive to build out more concrete relationships with Industry,
and I aim to help any future holders of this position with a master
record of all our industry contacts to ensure the smooth running of the
society.</p>
