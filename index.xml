      <description>Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is a computing platform which powers somewhere between 30-50% of the entire web. Chances are you&amp;rsquo;re using something that runs on it right now. AWS provides compute, databases, storage, API services, but also some more obscure things like blockchain and even managed satellite groundstations and robotics applications.
In this workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn to make a &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; (yes, I know - it&amp;rsquo;s a dumb name&amp;hellip;) application from scratch using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.</description>

      <description>Even if you have the best service in the world, it is all for nought if no one can access it. In this workshop GenSec James will be talking and walking you through hosting a web server serving the popular game Wordle, including steps such as DNS, Firewall, Ports, security hardening and other best practices.
This knowledge can be applied to hosting almost any service in an internet accessible way, whether a website, game server, API, or something else.</description>

      <guid>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-03-01-python-internals-talk/</guid>
      <description>What actually happens when you tell Python to print(&amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;)? How does your computer turn the characters you type into something it understands, and then how exactly is this executed? What does it even mean to compile Python code - isn&amp;rsquo;t it an interpreted language?
All of these questions and more will be answered in this talk. Using Python as an example, Zac will give an in-depth look into how interpreted programming languages work from the ground up.</description>

No knowledge of either of these topics is required, although a bit of experience with programming of any kind will be useful.</description>

      <guid>https://hacksocnotts.co.uk/events/2022-02-10-early-email-talk/</guid>
      <description>In this talk, Dr Julian Onions talks a little about the history of email, and how we gradually connected our computers together so we could communicate world wide and work on projects together. He was involved in getting Nottingham University on the net in it&amp;rsquo;s early days, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t all plain sailing. So - a bit of history, a bit about protocols, a bit of politics, and a lot of good old fashioned hacking to get us where we are today.</description>

      <description>In this talk Pete Gallagher takes you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.
We begin by talking about .NET 5 and seeing how easy it is to install .NET 5. Then we look through the various circuits and spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi. We see how the Servos are wired up and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.</description>

      <description>Come along to our first workshop of the year and learn how to make your own Discord bot using JavaScript!
Prior knowledge of JavaScript or programming in general isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary, as we&amp;rsquo;ll be explaining everything as we go along. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using the discord.js library, which will be the main focus of the workshop.
There&amp;rsquo;ll be a quick introduction to the discord.js library, and then you&amp;rsquo;re free to make whatever crazy idea you might have for a bot!</description>
